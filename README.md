# PurePySci

Numerical and scientific computing algorithms using only pure Python. ...And handwritten C-extensions when adventageous. 

## Project motivations

What if society collapsed, the internet disappeared, and yet you, yes **you** inexplicably have been tasked with providing a numerically stable, memory efficient, and fast solution to the generlaized eigenvalue problem to ensure your survival? Can you code up a way to find the nontrivial solutions to $$H\Psi = E\Psi$$ without the help of something like ``np.linalg.eig``? 

Python is an excellent tool to teach others about programming because of its English-like syntax. Likewise, Python offers an extensive catalog of powerful 3rd party libraries that prevent users from writing redundant code. Of these libraries, NumPy provides people an invaluable resource for n-dimensional array data structures and numerical computing. NumPy presents the solution to a solved problem in Python, a way for people to have fast arrays and ways to perform math efficiently on them. NumPy also employs 3rd party libraries like the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK), a wonderful tool that serves as the backbone of countless programs since its inception in the 90s, for higher order operations ranging from matrix multiplication to solving the prior albatross, the generaized eigenvalue problem. While a person curious about numerical computing can certainly read the NumPy and LAPACK source codes to learn more about their fundamentals, both libraries largely have implementations in C and Fortran written for high performance rather than for education.
